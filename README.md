 Designed and implemented a Hartley Oscillator circuit using BJT configuration on a breadboard to produce stable
 sinusoidal waveforms.â€“ Selected LC components and ensured proper transistor biasing for stable oscillations.Tested circuit performance
 using DSO and analyzed frequency output and waveform quality.
